# monsterfight

This is a simple concept to show off a fight between a character and a monster.
It utilizes Javascript to generate data on a character and a monster. Then we "roll a 20 sided dice" and check against the stats of the monster to see if we hit.
If hit we reduce the HP. Once either the monster or character are at 0 HP the game is over and the page refreshes.

This is test concept code that I want to apply to a bigger text adventure game I am working on.
